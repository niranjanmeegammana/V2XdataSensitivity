# V2XdataSensitivity
Evaluating Dataset Sensitivity and Scalability in RNN Models for V2X Attack Detection
Abstract
With the rapid adoption of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, real-time intrusion detection has become critical to ensuring vehicular safety. This study investigates how dataset size impacts the performance of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models—specifically LSTM, GRU, and their hybrid variants with self-attention—for detecting V2X attacks using the VeReMi Extension dataset. Six balanced datasets, ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 records, were constructed to evaluate detection performance, inference latency, and resource usage across varied scales. Experimental results show that larger datasets improve F1 scores and model generalization, though performance gains plateau beyond 120,000 samples. The hybrid LSTM+GRU+Attention model consistently achieved the highest accuracy, while GRU demonstrated superior efficiency and recall, making it well-suited for real-time, resource-constrained edge deployments. These findings provide practical insights into designing scalable, accurate, and resource-aware intrusion detection systems for V2X environments.
